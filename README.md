# ktao3_thinfilms
 Python scripts used to process data for KTaO3 MSci Project, along with plots. All scripts in the library contain functions which detail how to use them.


- Most of the data analysis was performed in the data_analysis.py file. Uncomment functions as necessary to use.
- Must pip install thinfilm to use this script (run 'pip install -e .' in terminal of parent directory). May also require pip install of setuptools.
- Any further adjustments can be made by directly editing the functions within the thinfilm directory.
